# bug-bounty-tools

I have made a small helpful script for myself to do some of the recon for bug-bounty, now I thought of sharing it to the people who are interested in automation related things.

Disclaimer:- I have made this script only based on TERMUX (yes I am a termux hacker....)

Usage:-
bash install.sh


bash recon.sh hackerone.com
